# MW Design

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/thousight/MW-Design.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

My personal UI library built with styled-component, the goal of it is to be as slim and minimum as possible, but at the same time able to be themed.

## Getting started

`yarn add styled-components csstype styled-system mw-design`
